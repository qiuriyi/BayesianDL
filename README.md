Models and codes for my dissertation research "Modeling Uncertainty in Deep Learning Models of Electronic Health Records"

This repo will be used for storing all my contents related to the Bayesian Neural Networks. I am still running the rest of the experiments. Notebooks to be uploaded when they are finalized.

Models for patient-level uncertainty (each comes with CNN version and RNN version):
1. Heteroscedastic NN (HNN) + Dropout
2. Deep Ensemble + Dropout

Models for feature-level uncertainty:
1. HNN + variational convolotional layer (VCNN)
2. HNN + variational gated recurrent unit (VRNN/VGRU)
3. Dropout + VCNN
4. Dropout + VGRU
